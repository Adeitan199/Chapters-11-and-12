Exception

An exception is an object that represents some kind of exceptional condition in lines of codes set for execution.  It indicates that something has gone wrong at a point in the build-up of the code. 
This could be a programming error—attempting to divide by zero, attempting to invoke a method on an object that does not define the method, or passing an invalid argument to a method. It could also result 
from some kind of external condition—making a network request when the network is down, or trying to create an object when the system is out of memory.

Exception Handling

Exception handling is use to handle situations in the lines of code the could obstruct the code for successful implementation. 
This is primarily to avert the situation that could make the program crash. Exception handling can be performed at both the 
software (as part of the program itself) and hardware levels (using mechanisms built into the design of the CPU).

How to Catch Exceptions

The Try, Catch, Finally construction is usually used to handle exceptions in programs. The try-catch-finally method is already domiciled in the
Exceeptin class.
Exception handling messages can also be customised to give specific information on the actual actions that need to be performed for successful 
execution of a program.
